# Python Chat Application via TCP Socket
This project is for the completion of the `Laboratory Exercise #1` for `IT 238 - Network and Client/Server Computing`.   

Simple Client-Server Chat application using Python TCP/IP Socket Programming.

## Program Description: 
The server process runs on your Linux machine that waits for a client to establish a `TCP/IP connection`. The client may run on your laptop or any other client device with a network connection to your server. Once a connection is established, the client/server may send chat messages between each other. Display in a scrolling screen the exchange of messages. Messages are entered in a message entry box and are sent as a stream after pressing the `<enter>` key. Pressing `<ctrl-x>` will terminate the program.
